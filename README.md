This is a study of the usefullness of filters by applying a DTFT on them.
I then applied these filters onto some noisy audio in an attempt to clean it up.

The result, man_clean.wav, is perfectly serviceable!

To compile the matlab project:
1. open "eel3135_lab06_skeleton.m" in MATLAB.
2. Make sure that "man_noisy.wav" and "man_noisy2.wav" are in the same directory as the matlab file.
3. Compile the file as normal, a series of windows displaying information about the filter will show up.
4. In addition, 2 files will be created: "man_clean.wav" and "man_clean2.wav"
